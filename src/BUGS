Known bugs; feel free to submit fixes!
======================================

libvx32
-------
need to do a better job mapping SIGFPE back to hardware floating-point errors

9vx
---
gs spins on startup, cause unknown.  (run "gs", no arguments)

blank line inserted when kernel terminal scrolls

can cause sigsegv panic resizing the window, rarely

if you use -r xxx where xxx is an empty directory,
9vx just sits there after printing the 256MB memory line,
with no indication what you did wrong.
